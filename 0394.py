# Project 394. Dance generation system
# Description:
# A dance generation system involves creating dance movements from a given input, such as music or movement sequences. The goal is to generate coherent and expressive dance sequences that correspond to a specific rhythm, style, or theme. This can be useful in applications like robotic dance, virtual performances, and motion capture analysis. In this project, we will implement a simple dance generation system using a neural network that learns to generate dance movements based on input features like music or previous dance movements.

# 🧪 Python Implementation (Dance Generation System):
# For simplicity, we will use motion capture data and generate dance sequences based on music or a pre-defined sequence of movements. This can be further enhanced with generative models like RNNs or GANs to create continuous dance sequences.

# 1. Define a simple LSTM-based model for dance generation
class DanceGenerationModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, hidden_units=128):
        super(DanceGenerationModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm1 = LSTM(hidden_units, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(None, input_size))
        self.lstm2 = LSTM(hidden_units, return_sequences=False)
        self.fc = Dense(output_size)
    
    def call(self, x):
        x = self.lstm1(x)
        x = self.lstm2(x)
        return self.fc(x)
 
# 2. Sample dataset for dance movements (simplified as random data for demonstration)
def generate_synthetic_dance_data(num_samples=1000, sequence_length=50, feature_dim=10):
    # Generate random dance sequences (pose data)
    X = np.random.rand(num_samples, sequence_length, feature_dim)
    y = np.random.rand(num_samples, feature_dim)  # Random output (next movement in sequence)
    return X, y
 
# 3. Prepare dataset for training
X, y = generate_synthetic_dance_data()
 
# 4. Train the Dance Generation model
input_size = X.shape[2]  # Number of features in each timestep (e.g., 3D pose coordinates)
output_size = y.shape[1]  # Output feature size (e.g., pose data for the next timestep)
 
model = DanceGenerationModel(input_size, output_size)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
 
# Train the model (using synthetic data here)
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
 
# 5. Generate a dance sequence
def generate_dance_sequence(model, initial_sequence, num_steps=50):
    generated_sequence = initial_sequence
    for _ in range(num_steps):
        prediction = model.predict(generated_sequence[-1].reshape(1, 1, -1))  # Predict next step
        generated_sequence = np.append(generated_sequence, prediction, axis=1)  # Append to sequence
    return generated_sequence
 
# 6. Generate and display dance movement (simplified visualization)
initial_sequence = np.random.rand(1, 1, input_size)  # Random start for the sequence
generated_dance = generate_dance_sequence(model, initial_sequence)
 
# 7. Visualize the generated dance movement (simplified as 2D data)
plt.plot(generated_dance[0, :, 0], label='X Position')
plt.plot(generated_dance[0, :, 1], label='Y Position')
plt.plot(generated_dance[0, :, 2], label='Z Position')

# ✅ What It Does:
# Generates dance movements using an LSTM-based model that learns from synthetic movement data.

# The model learns a sequence of dance poses and can generate new dance sequences based on an initial input.

# For simplicity, the example uses random synthetic data, but real-world applications would use motion capture data or pose data to train the model.

# Visualizes the generated dance sequence by plotting the generated movement data for the X, Y, and Z positions (as a simplified 2D plot).

# Key features:
# LSTM-based model is used to generate sequences, learning the temporal dependencies in dance movements.

# Synthetic data is used for training, but this can be replaced with motion capture or dance pose datasets for more realistic results.

# Dance sequence generation involves predicting the next set of movements in the sequence based on previous steps.
